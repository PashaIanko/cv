  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm an Artificial Intelligence Specialist at UNOX S.p.A, Italy. My role spans software, hardware, and machine learning, with a touch of UI design. I simplify technicalities, presenting results clearly, with visual data analysis insights.

    At UNOX, I am responsible for an Optic.Cooking technology [(link)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7093171586744164352/) - automatic food recognition system for ovens.

    As a former Research Associate at the Institute of Thermophysics, I cultivated an experimenter mindset and clear communication skills. Since 2014, I've been learning a confident public presentation:

    - International Young Physicists' Tournaments in England (2014) and Thailand (2015);
    - International Student conferences in 2015, 2018, 2019;
    - Numerous university projects, BSc and MSc presentations.

    I'm driven by technical projects that simplify our lives. I contribute through an [AI-driven YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Tick-TalkAnswers) and [educational Machine Learning blog](https://pashaianko.github.io/).

    Facts about me:

    - Language lover: certified C1 in English, fluent Italian, progressing in German;
    - Both Ð²egrees with Honors in Bachelors (Physical Informatics) and Masters (Data Science);
    - Patented my BSc project software for the Institute of Thermophysics;
    - Received a fully-funded scholarship at the University of Padua (20 positions, 70000 students); 
    - Created an AI-driven YouTube channel [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/@Tick-TalkAnswers) and ML blog [(link)](https://pashaianko.github.io/).
    - Silver medal winner at the International Young Physicists' Tournament, in England ('14) and Thailand ('15).
